### Data Model

# Introduction

The ECVM script is composed of multiple steps. In each step, one or more datasets are required as input and one or more new datasets are produced as output. HTML files for immediate checks are also produced This page described the data models of such datasets. Datasets are divided into three groups:

* datasets to be exported: datasets and csv
* main datasets: individual-level observations on PERSONS and on the study populations
* HTML to be inspected: these are HTML file containing rapid descriptions of the datasets to be
exported and of the main individual-level datasets
* functional datasets: inetremdiate steps to obtain the previous datasets
